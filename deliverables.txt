* Introduction

This note presents a proposed list of MOC / HIL project deliverables,
developed from 1-May-2017 onwards.

* System Summary

The MOC / HIL system includes the following software components, some
of which are extant today, and some of which are developed for use in
the MOC / HIL system.

1. The existing Slurm gang scheduler, used by the MOC/HIL software to
   reserve compute nodes for subsequent HIL operations, and for
   identifying and maintaining the state of compute nodes when not
   under control of HIL.

2. A small set of user-mode commands for reserving and releasing
   compute nodes for HIL operations, developed for the MOC/HIL
   project.

3. A privileged monitor, developed for the MOC/HIL project, which
   detects new reservations and initiates HIL operations on reserved
   nodes.  The monitor also returns compute nodes released from HIL
   operations and reservations to a known state, again participating
   in Slurm cluster operations.

4. A body of code, developed for the MOC/HIL project, which interfaces
   the HIL monitor (#3 above) to existing or updated HIL node
   management software.

5. A related body of code, developed for the MOC/HIL project, which
   interfaces the HIL monitor (#3 above) to new or existing code which
   tracks the state of compute nodes and interconnecting network
   elements.


* Existing Software

  - Slurm gang scheduler
  - HIL node management software
  - MOC node and network management software


* MOC / HIL Completed Items

  - hil_reserve and hil_release commands

  - Slurm control daemon prolog and epilog for Slurm / MOC / HIL
    reservation management

  - Library of support routines for interface of MOC / HIL to Slurm
    control commands

  - Installation scripts for MOC / HIL setup on Slurm controller and
    compute nodes.  Includes Slurm installation as well, to allow
    application to new VMs for test purposes.

  - HIL infrastructure (pre-existing)

  - Slurm MOC / HIL reservation monitor framework


* MOC / HIL Work Remaining

1. Understand HIL functions and API

2. Develop interface between MOC / HIL reservation monitor and HIL
   infrastructure

3. Develop interface between MOC / HIL reservation monitor and HIL
   node and network state maintenance code

4. Develop MOC / HIL reservation state storage, or equivalent, to
   support hil_release operations

5. Develop Additional priviliged and non-privileged software to
   maintain MOC / HIL system, as required

6. Installation infrastructure, including definition of same

7. System test

8. Documentation
